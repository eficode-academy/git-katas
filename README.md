# Git Katas

## Quick Start

- Clone this repository
- Go into the folder you want to solve an exercise in
- Run the `setup.sh` script
- Consult the README.md in that folder to get a exercise description


## Purpose of Git Katas

In this repository you find a bunch of Git exercises.
The concept is stolen without shame from [Schauderhaft.de](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/gitkata/).
They have unfortunately not maintained the system - and we need more good Git exercises.

The exercises are designed for use when we are teaching Git courses. You should be able to use them as self-contained exercises that will allow you to keep your Git skills sharp.

Exercises starting with _basic_ are entry-level - other exercises vary greatly in difficulty.

To get an overview of the exercises in here look in [Overview.md](Overview.md).

Feel free to use these exercises, that's why they're public!
