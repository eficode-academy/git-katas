# gitkatas

## Setup:

1. Run `. setup.sh` (or `.\setup.ps1` in PowerShell)

## Detached head state

The user has ended up in a "detached head" state in the `kata3-detached-head-master` branch.

This is a scary situation for the user, but as we know, git is not scary.

Run `git status` - see what is going on

Restore normalcy in this repository by moving to `kata3-detached-head`

Note that this task might seem more confusing if you did not run `setup.sh` in your terminal.
