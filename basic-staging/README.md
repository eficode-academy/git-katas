# Git Kata: Basic Staging

This kata will examine the staging area of git.

In git we are working with three different areas:

* The working directory where you are making your changes
* The staging area where all changes you have added through `git add` will stay
* The repository where every commit ends up, making your history. To put your staged changes in here you issue the `git commit` command.

A file can have changes both in the working directory and staging area at the same time.
These changes do not have to be the same.

We will also work with `git reset` to reset the staged changes of a file, and `git checkout` to return a file to a previous state.

## Setup

1. Run `source setup.sh` (or `.\setup.ps1` in PowerShell)

## The task

You live in your own repository. There is a file called `file.txt`.

1. What's the content of `file.txt`?
2. Overwrite the content in `file.txt`: `echo 2 > file.txt` to change the state of your file in the working directory (or `sc file.txt '2'` in PowerShell)
3. What does `git diff` tell you?
4. What does `git diff --staged` tell you? why is this blank?
5. Run `git add file.txt` to stage your changes from the working directory.
6. What does `git diff` tell you?
7. What does `git diff --staged` tell you?
8. Overwrite the content in `file.txt`: `echo 3 > file.txt` to change the state of your file in the working directory (or `sc file.txt '3'` in PowerShell).
9. What does `git diff` tell you?
10. What does `git diff --staged` tell you?
11. Explain what is happening
12. Run `git status` and observe that `file.txt` are present twice in the output.
13. Run `git reset HEAD file.txt` to unstage the change
14. What does `git status` tell you now?
15. Stage the change and make a commit
16. What does the log look like?
17. Overwrite the content in `file.txt`: `echo 4 > file.txt` (or `sc file.txt '4'` in PowerShell)
18. What is the content of `file.txt`?
19. What does `git status` tell us?
20. Run `git checkout file.txt`
21. What is the content of `file.txt`?
22. What does `git status` tell us?

## Useful commands

- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git commit -m "My lazy short commit message"`
- `git reset`
- `git log`
- `git log -n 5`
- `git log --oneline`
- `git log --oneline --graph`
- `git reset HEAD`
- `git checkout`

## Aliases

You can set up aliases as such:
`git config --global alias.lol 'log --oneline --graph --all'`
This might be useful to you.
